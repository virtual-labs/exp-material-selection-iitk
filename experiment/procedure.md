1. The experiment has been carried out using Monte Carlo Simulation in which dynamic variables are updated at each time interval with random numbers to study the microscopic and dynamic behavior of various systems.<br>
2. Here each element is characterized by strength parameter 's' and slip probability. The concept of load shedding i.e. transfer of load to neighboring sites when slip occurs is considered.<br>
3. The model assumes that strain hardening and recovery processes can be ignored for small strain regime and materials with low hardening rates, that obstacle density and its behavior does not change during the deformation process and that materials respond to plastic deformation in the same way because the observed behavior is due to a large number of discrete events coupled through load transfer.
